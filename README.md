+ [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
+ [Git for Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
+ [Git for Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

<h3>Use</h3>
<p>
Download and Install from link above.
<br>
Open Git Bash.
<br>
Initially, you will need to navigate to the github repo. <br>
	$ cd Desktop/github <br>
or<br>
	$ cd Desktop<br>
	$ cd github<br>
<br>
Now that you have navigated into the repo (folder), you need to make sure your 
git credentials are entered.<br>
	$ git config user.name git_username<br>
	$ git config user.email git_emailaddress<br>
<br>
Once you have made your changes to the files within your github repo, you add
the changes from your working directory to the index (staging).<br>
	$ git add *<br>
or<br>	
	$ git add filename.txt filename.java<br>
<br>
Now we commit the changes from the index to the head (commiting). <br>
	$ git commit -m "some message about changes"<br>
<br>
Lastly, we push the changes to the repo, usually the master branch.<br>
	$ git push origin master<br>
</p>
